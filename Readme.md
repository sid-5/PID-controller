## PID-Controller For Self Balancing Ball On Beam
In this project we are trying to balance a ball on a V-beam by taking input from user where to balance it(eg. balance at 12cm point i.e 12cm away from the edge having the IR sensor).
We are using the PIR algorithm by taking input for the IR sensor present at one edge of the V-beam and using the servo motor attached to the leg of the V-beam to change the orientation of the beam that in turn moves the ball along the beam.
